About me
========

My name is Bertrand Bordage, I was born in 1989.

Work
----

I’m a freelance developer in Rouen, France.  I mainly build web applications
for french public institutions such as
the `CNRS <http://www.cnrs.fr/>`_ (National Center for Scientific Research)
and the universities of
`Rouen <http://www.univ-rouen.fr/>`_
& `Montpellier III <http://www.univ-montp3.fr/>`_.

Two projects I build and maintain since 2011: `Dezède <https://dezede.org/>`_
and `Criminocorpus <https://criminocorpus.org>`_.


Programmation
-------------

I love `Python <https://www.python.org>`_, its simplicity, its readability,
its ecosystem.

Since I’m perfectionist, I like to optimize my code (in terms of both
performance and readability) and choose wisely my dependencies.  This blog
was started to share my findings.

As a web developer, I of course have to use another language.  A terrible
one.  Let’s not talk about it and pretend it never existed.

Sometimes, I also code in `Cython <http://cython.org/>`_ or C, especially
when I use OpenGL.

In the past, I used Scheme and Z80 assembly.


Music
-----

I also love baroque music.  I sing arias and play harpsichord & organ whenever
I can.

`Le Poème Harmonique <http://www.lepoemeharmonique.fr/>`_ is by far
my favorite ensemble.  If you don’t understand french, listen to one of
their discs:
`Nova metamorfosi <http://www.lepoemeharmonique.fr/#/en/records/nova-metamorfosi>`_,
`Il Fásolo ? <http://www.lepoemeharmonique.fr/#/en/enregistrements/il-fasolo>`_, or
`Aux marches du palais <http://www.lepoemeharmonique.fr/#/en/records/aux-marches-du-palais>`_.
**You’ll probably weep from bliss.**
Otherwise, I also advise you to watch their outstanding reconstitution of
`Le Bourgeois gentilhomme <http://www.lepoemeharmonique.fr/#/fr/enregistrements/le-bourgeois-gentilhomme>`_
by Molière & Lully.
